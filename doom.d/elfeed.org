#+title: Elfeed

Okay, so, org-mode nodes represent topics parsed into the RSS reader (elfeed),
with feeds assigned tags by their parent headings. I'm also including my
favorite articles by a specific post with lists that aren't parsed. So this
might be of use for anyone who wanders into it without religiously using elfeed.

A blog I found while reading about the gemini protocol.
*** News :news:
The news is probably a  [[http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews][waste of time]]. Limiting it down to specific publications
relevant to my interest/career.
**** Top news :tops:
Top News RSS feeds generally showing the most "notable" events for a day.
NOTE: keeping this here for maybe future use, otherwise, just get your friends
to tell you what's going on

*** YouTube :youtube:
Note that it doesn't naturally parse, and you need to enter the XML for
elfeed-tube to pick it up. I've been using  https://rssbox.herokuapp.com to get
the links.

**** Linux :linux:
***** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg][DistroTube]]

*** Podcasts :podcast:
I've seen workflows that allow for mpd/mpc and emms to listen to podcasts inside
emacs but it seemed fiddly. I plan to list podcasts that have
ancillary content here, otherwise I'll use a dedicated podcasting app.
