Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do. @@latex:\mbox{@@--- Donald Knuth@@latex:}@@

* Rudimentary configuration

Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no

** Personal Information

It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Justin"
      user-mail-address "justin@justin.vc"
      calendar-latitude 39.0
      calendar-longitude -84.6
      calendar-location-name "Villa Hills, KY"
      calendar-time-zone-rule "EST"
      calendar-standard-time-zone-name "EST"
      calendar-daylight-time-zone-name "EDT")
#+end_src
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authinfo.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidentally purge this file (I have done
src_shell{rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before}. I also want to cache as much as possible, as
my home machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)

*** Diary functions

Some useful things for the diary. This allows sunrise and sunset to be put into
seperate times for agenda viewing.

** Better defaults
*** Simple settings

Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(setq exec-path (append exec-path '("~/.local/bin/")))

(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words

(global-set-key
        [remap dabbrev-expand] 'hippie-expand)    ; Replace dabbrev with hippie-expand
#+end_src
*** Frame sizing

It's nice to control the size of new frames, when launching Emacs that can be
done with src_shell{emacs -geometry 160x48}. After the font size adjustment
during initialisation this works out to be ~102x31~.

Thanks to hotkeys, it's easy for me to expand a frame to half/full-screen, so it
makes sense to be conservative with the sizing of new frames.

Then, for creating new frames within the same Emacs instance, we'll just set the
default to be something roughly 80% of that size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+end_src
*** Auto-customisations

By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src
*** Windows

I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up a buffer prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      ;; Navigation
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
      "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
      "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
      "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
      ;; Swapping windows
      "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
      "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
      "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
      "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
#+end_src
*** Buffer defaults

I'd much rather have my new buffers in org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

       <<doom-completion>>

       )
#+end_src

**** Structure

As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).
#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(default +bindings +smartparens)
#+end_src

**** Interface

There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

It's just too convenient being able to have everything in Emacs.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face

'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match.  🕵🏽
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono" :size 16)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono" :size 20)

#+end_src

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.

#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar required-fonts '("FiraCode Nerd Font" "Overpass" "JuliaMono" "IBM Plex Mono" "Merriweather" "Alegreya"))

(defvar available-fonts
  (delete-dups (or (font-family-list)
                   (split-string (shell-command-to-string "fc-list : family")
                                 "[,\n]"))))

(defvar missing-fonts
  (delq nil (mapcar
             (lambda (font)
               (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                           (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))
                                         available-fonts))
                 font))
             required-fonts)))

(if missing-fonts
    (pp-to-string
     `(unless noninteractive
        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook
          (run-at-time nil nil
                       (lambda ()
                         (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                  (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                  (mapconcat (lambda (font)

                                             ',missing-fonts
                                             ", "))
                         (sleep-for 0.5))))))
  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<detect-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

**** Theme and modeline

I wrote a simple function that looks up what wallpaper was chosen by ~wal~, then
takes the first word to assign a theme. Normally I'd just use the Xresources
theme directly, but with the amount of customization, I think I'd  need to edit
it more.

This allows me to pick a specific doom-theme matching with the loaded
wallpaper, as I name them similarly, e.g. a pink wallpaper would be
~pink-blah-blah.png~, otherwise it just sticks with ~doom-vibrant~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.doom.d/themes/")
(setq theme-name (nth 0 (split-string (nth 0 (last
  (split-string
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents-literally "~/.cache/wal/wal")
    (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))) "/"))) "-")))

(cond
  ((string= theme-name "cyberpunk") (setq doom-theme 'doom-tokyo-night))
  ((string= theme-name "synthwave") (setq doom-theme 'doom-laserwave))
  ((string= theme-name "orange") (setq doom-theme 'doom-old-hope))
  ((string= theme-name "pink") (setq doom-theme 'doom-laserwave))
  ((string= theme-name "white") (setq doom-theme 'doom-homage-black))
  (t (setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)))

(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

**** Miscellaneous

Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

*** Some helper macros

There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

#+end_src
*** Elisp REPL

I think an elisp REPL sounds like a fun idea, even if not a particularly useful
one 😛. We can do this by adding a new command in =cli.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el
(defcli! repl ((in-rlwrap-p ["--rl"] "For internal use only."))
  "Start an elisp REPL."
  (when (and (executable-find "rlwrap") (not in-rlwrap-p))
    ;; For autocomplete
    (setq autocomplete-file "/tmp/doom_elisp_repl_symbols")
    (unless (file-exists-p autocomplete-file)
      (princ "\e[0;33mInitialising autocomplete list...\e[0m\n")
      (with-temp-buffer
        (cl-do-all-symbols (s)
          (let ((sym (symbol-name s)))
            (when (string-match-p "\\`[[:ascii:]][[:ascii:]]+\\'" sym)
              (insert sym "\n"))))
        (write-region nil nil autocomplete-file)))
    (princ "\e[F")
    (throw 'exit (list "rlwrap" "-f" autocomplete-file
                       (concat doom-emacs-dir "bin/doom") "repl" "--rl")))

*** Asynchronous config tangling

Doom adds an =org-mode= hook ~+literate-enable-recompile-h~. This is a nice idea,

*** Htmlize command

Why not have a command to htmlize files? This is basically a little test of my
engrave-faces package because it somehow seems to work without a GUI, while the
htmlize package doesn't.

*** Dashboard quick actions

When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap ()
  (setq +doom-dashboard-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
  (map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
        :desc "Find file" :ne "f" #'find-file
        :desc "Recent files" :ne "r" #'consult-recent-file
        :desc "Config dir" :ne "C" #'doom/open-private-config
        :desc "Open config.org" :ne "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-private-dir)))
        :desc "Open elfeed summary" :ne "e" #'elfeed-summary
        :desc "Open dotfile" :ne "." (cmd! (doom-project-find-file "~/.config/"))
        :desc "Notes (roam)" :ne "n" #'org-roam-node-find
        :desc "Switch buffer" :ne "b" #'+vertico/switch-workspace-buffer
        :desc "Switch buffers (all)" :ne "B" #'consult-buffer
        :desc "IBuffer" :ne "i" #'ibuffer
        :desc "Agenda"  :ne "o" #'org-agenda
        :desc "Previous buffer" :ne "p" #'previous-buffer
        :desc "Set theme" :ne "t" #'consult-theme
        :desc "Quit" :ne "Q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        :desc "Show keybindings" :ne "h" (cmd! (which-key-show-keymap '+doom-dashboard-mode-map))))

(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
#+end_src

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

Now that the dashboard is so convenient, I'll want to make it easier to get to.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader :desc "Dashboard" "d" #'+doom-dashboard/open)
#+end_src

** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src
*** Window title

I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.
*** Splash screen

Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice Emacs-style /E/. I was using the
blackhole image, but as I've stripped down the splash screen I've switched to
just using the /E/.

Now the only thing missing is a an extra interesting line, whether that be some
corporate BS, an developer excuse, or a fun (useless) fact.

The following is rather long, but it essentially
+ fetches a phrase from an API
+ inserts it into the dashboard (asynchronously)
+ moves ~point~ to the phrase
+ re-uses the last phrase for requests within a few seconds of it being fetched

Lastly, the doom dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful to me.
So, we'll disable them and then for a particularly /clean/ look disable

*** Systemd daemon

For running a systemd service for a Emacs server I have the following
#+name: emacsclient service
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service :mkdirp yes
[Unit]
Description=Emacs server daemon
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=sh -c 'emacs --daemon && emacsclient -c --eval "(delete-frame)"'
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --no-wait --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook nil) (kill emacs))"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

which is then enabled by
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled emacs.service")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
#+end_src

For some reason if a frame isn't opened early in the initialisation process, the
daemon doesn't seem to like opening frames later --- hence the ~&& emacsclient~
part of the =ExecStart= value.

It can now be nice to use this as a 'default app' for opening files. If we add
an appropriate desktop entry, and enable it in the desktop environment.

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacs-client.desktop :mkdirp yes

#+end_src

When the daemon is running, I almost always want to do a few particular things
with it, so I may as well eat the load time at startup. We also want to keep
=mu4e= running.

It would be good to start the IRC client (=circe=) too, but that seems to have
issues when started in a non-graphical session.

Lastly, while I'm not sure quite why it happens, but after a bit it seems that
new Emacsclient frames start on the =*scratch*= buffer instead of the dashboard.
I prefer the dashboard, so let's ensure that's always switched to in new frames.

#+name: daemon initialisation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Emacs client wrapper

I frequently want to make use of Emacs while in a terminal emulator. To make
this easier, I can construct a few handy aliases.

However, a little convenience script in =~/.local/bin= can have the same effect,
be available beyond the specific shell I plop the alias in, then also allow me
to add a few bells and whistles --- namely:
+ Accepting stdin by putting it in a temporary file and immediately opening it.
+ Guessing that the =tty= is a good idea when ~$DISPLAY~ is unset (relevant with SSH
  sessions, among other things).
+ With a whiff of 24-bit color support, sets ~TERM~ variable to a =terminfo= that
  (probably) announces 24-bit color support.
+ Changes GUI =emacsclient= instances to be non-blocking by default (~--no-wait~),
  and instead take a flag to suppress this behaviour (~-w~).

I would use =sh=, but using arrays for argument manipulation is just too
convenient, so I'll raise the requirement to =bash=. Since arrays are the only
'extra' compared to =sh=, other shells like =ksh= etc. should work too.

* Packages
** Loading Instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~ macro in
=packages.el=, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line.
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

You'll then need to restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least,
run =M-x doom/reload=.

*Warning*: Don't disable core packages listed in =~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el=.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror

To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages from git repositories

To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages

If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src
** Convenience
*** Avy

#+begin_quote
From the =:config default= module.
#+end_quote

What a wonderful way to jump to buffer positions, and it uses the QWERTY
home-row for jumping.

*** Rotate (window management)

The =rotate= package just adds the ability to rotate window layouts, but that
sounds nice to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! rotate :pin "4e9ac3ff800880bd9b705794ef0f7c99d72900a6")
#+end_src

*** Which-key

#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Let's make this popup a bit faster
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
#+end_src

** Tools
*** Abbrev

Thanks to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45462/use-a-single-abbrev-table-for-multiple-modes/45476#45476][use a single abbrev-table for multiple modes? - Emacs Stack Exchange]] I
have the following.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook
          (defun +abbrev-file-name ()
            (setq-default abbrev-mode t)
            (setq abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "abbrev.el" doom-private-dir))))
#+end_src
*** Conda

This lets me switch conda environments within python files. Since I primarily
use them as a data scientist, I figure, can't hurt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! conda)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! conda
  :init
  (setq conda-anaconda-home (expand-file-name "~/anaconda3"))
  (setq conda-env-home-directory (expand-file-name "~/anaconda3")))
#+end_src

*** Deft

This might require some config, but I'm not entirely sure how useful this is
considering node-find for roam works. Overlapping / maybe use for org in general.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package deft
:commands (deft)
:config
  (setq deft-directory "~/.org/")
  (setq deft-recursive t)
  (setq deft-strip-summary-regexp
  (concat "\\("
	  "^:.+:.*" ; any line with a :SOMETHING:
	  "\\|^#\\+.*\n" ; anyline starting with a #+
	  "\\|^\\*.+.*\n" ; anyline where an asterisk starts the line
	  "\\)"))
     )

(advice-add 'deft-parse-title :override
    (lambda (file contents)
      (if deft-use-filename-as-title
	  (deft-base-filename file)
	(let* ((case-fold-search 't)
	       (begin (string-match "title: " contents))
	       (end-of-begin (match-end 0))
	       (end (string-match "\n" contents begin)))
	  (if begin
	      (substring contents end-of-begin end)
	    (format "%s" file))))))

#+end_src

*** Eros

#+begin_quote
From the =:tools eval= module.
#+end_quote

This package enables the very nice inline evaluation with =gr= and =gR=. The prefix
could be slightly nicer though.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq eros-eval-result-prefix "⟹ ") ; default =>
#+end_src

*** EVIL

#+begin_quote
From the =:editor evil= module.
#+end_quote

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.

Now, EVIL cares a fair bit about keeping compatibility with Vim's default
behaviour. I don't. There are some particular settings that I'd rather be
something else, so let's change them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

Sets the key-sequence "jk" for escape, allowing a quick hit of these to allow
escaping insert mode. I might revisit this option, since technically anytime I
want to say "lol jk" to somene, it would escape, but then I realized: "When the
heck am I going to use that in emacs text", so it seems fine.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
; (package! evil-escape :disable t/) ; Disabling the package if needed
(setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "jk")
#+end_src

*** Consult

#+begin_quote
From the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Since we're using [[Marginalia]] too, the separation between buffers and files is
already clear, and there's no need for a different face.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! consult
  (set-face-attribute 'consult-file nil :inherit 'consult-buffer)
  (setf (plist-get (alist-get 'perl consult-async-split-styles-alist) :initial) ";"))
#+end_src

*** Magit

#+begin_quote
From the =:tools magit= module.
#+end_quote

Magit is great as-is, thanks for making such a lovely package [[https://github.com/tarsius][Jonas]]!

**** Commit message templates

One little thing I want to add is some per-project commit message templates.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +magit-project-commit-templates-alist nil
  "Alist of toplevel dirs and template strings/functions.")
(after! magit
  (defun +magit-fill-in-commit-template ()
    "Insert template from `+magit-fill-in-commit-template' if applicable."
    (when-let ((template (and (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (string-match-p "\\`\\s-*$" (thing-at-point 'line)))
                              (cdr (assoc (file-name-base (directory-file-name (magit-toplevel)))
                                          +magit-project-commit-templates-alist)))))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert (if (stringp template) template (funcall template)))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (end-of-line)))
  (add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook #'+magit-fill-in-commit-template 90))
#+end_src

This is particularly useful when creating commits for Org, as they need to
follow [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html#commit-messages][a certain format]] and sometimes I forget elements (oops!).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! magit
  (defun +org-commit-message-template ()
    "Create a skeleton for an Org commit message based on the staged diff."
    (let (change-data last-file file-changes temp-point)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (apply #'call-process magit-git-executable
               nil t nil
               (append
                magit-git-global-arguments
                (list "diff" "--cached")))
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "^@@\\|^\\+\\+\\+ b/" nil t)
          (if (looking-back "^\\+\\+\\+ b/" (line-beginning-position))
              (progn
                (push (list last-file file-changes) change-data)
                (setq last-file (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (line-end-position))
                      file-changes nil))
            (setq temp-point (line-beginning-position))
            (re-search-forward "^\\+\\|^-" nil t)
            (end-of-line)
            (cond
             ((string-match-p "\\.el$" last-file)
              (when (re-search-backward "^\\(?:[+-]? *\\|@@[ +-\\d,]+@@ \\)(\\(?:cl-\\)?\\(?:defun\\|defvar\\|defmacro\\|defcustom\\)" temp-point t)

                (add-to-list 'file-changes (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) (line-end-position)))))))))
      (push (list last-file file-changes) change-data)
      (setq change-data (delete '(nil nil) change-data))
      (concat
       (if (= 1 (length change-data))
           (replace-regexp-in-string "^.*/\\|.[a-z]+$" "" (caar change-data))
         "?")
       ": \n\n"
       (mapconcat
        (lambda (file-changes)
          (if (cadr file-changes)
              (format "* %s (%s): "
                      (car file-changes)
                      (mapconcat #'identity (cadr file-changes) ", "))
            (format "* %s: " (car file-changes))))
        change-data
        "\n\n"))))

  (add-to-list '+magit-project-commit-templates-alist (cons "org-mode" #'+org-commit-message-template)))
#+end_src

This relies on two small entries in the git config files which improves the hunk
heading line selection for elisp and Org files.
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(((;;;+ )|\\(|([ \t]+\\(((cl-|el-patch-)?def(un|var|macro|method|custom)|gb/))).*)$"

[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

*** Magit delta

[[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] is a git diff syntax highlighter written in rust. The author also wrote a
package to hook this into the magit diff view (which don't get any syntax
highlighting by default). This requires the ~delta~ binary. It's packaged on some
distributions, but most reliably installed through Rust's package manager cargo.

#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (or (not (executable-find "cargo")) (executable-find "delta")) "no" "setup.sh")
cargo install git-delta
#+end_src

Now we can make use of the package for this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;; (package! magit-delta :recipe (:host github :repo "dandavison/magit-delta") :pin "56cdffd377279589aa0cb1df99455c098f1848cf")
#+end_src

All that's left is to hook it into magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (after! magit
;;   (magit-delta-mode +1))
#+end_src
Unfortunately this currently seems to mess things up, which is something I'll
want to look into later.

*** Smerge

For repeated operations, a hydra would be helpful. But I prefer transient.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun smerge-repeatedly ()
  "Perform smerge actions again and again"
  (interactive)
  (smerge-mode 1)
  (smerge-transient))

     ["Other"
      ("c" "combine" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-combine-with-next)) (smerge-repeatedly)))

      ("q" "quit" (lambda () (interactive) (smerge-auto-leave)))]]))
#+end_src

*** Company

#+begin_quote
From the =:completion company= module.
#+end_quote

It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 1.0
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2

Now, the improvements from ~precedent~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Projectile

#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.

Looking at documentation via =SPC h f= and =SPC h v= and looking at the source can
add package src directories to projectile. This isn't desirable in my opinion.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** TRAMP

Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition

Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|\\)[^]#$%>\n]*#?[]#$%>] *\\(\\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z] *\\)*")) ;; default + 
#+end_src

**** Troubleshooting
In case the remote shell is misbehaving, here are some things to try

***** Zsh
There are some escape code you don't want, let's make it behave more considerately.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle no
if [[ "$TERM" == "dumb" ]]; then
    unset zle_bracketed_paste
    unset zle
    PS1='$ '
    return
fi
#+end_src

**** Guix

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] puts some binaries that TRAMP looks for in unexpected locations.
That's no problem though, we just need to help TRAMP find them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp

*** Etrace

The /Emacs Lisp Profiler/ (ELP) does a nice job recording information, but it
isn't the best for looking at results. =etrace= converts ELP's results to the
"Chromium Catapult Trace Event Format". This means that the output of =etrace= can
be loaded in something like the [[https://www.speedscope.app/][speedscope]] webapp for easier profile
investigation.

*** Modus themes

Proteolas did a lovely job with the Modus themes, so much so that they were
welcomed into Emacs 28. However, he is also rather attentive with updates, and
so I'd like to make sure we have a recent version.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! modus-themes :pin "5d35fed1ab7d2d59f64b2c5dcf77c05e64a0322e")

*** Theme magic

With all our fancy Emacs themes, my terminal is missing out!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! theme-magic :pin "844c4311bd26ebafd4b6a1d72ddcc65d87f074e3")
#+end_src

This operates using =pywal=, which is present in some repositories, but most
reliably installed with =pip=.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pywal
#+end_src

Theme magic takes a look at a number of faces, the saturation levels, and colour
differences to try to cleverly pick eight colours to use. However, it uses the
same colours for the light variants, and doesn't always make the best picks.
Since we're using =doom-themes=, our life is a little easier and we can use the
colour utilities from Doom themes to easily grab sensible colours and generate
lightened versions --- let's do that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! theme-magic
  :commands theme-magic-from-emacs

*** Emojify

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui emoji= module.
#+end_quote


For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB 😀.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar emojify-disabled-emojis
  '(;; Org
    "◼" "☑" "☸" "⚙" "⏩" "⏪" "⬆" "⬇" "❓"
    ;; Terminal powerline
    "✔"
    ;; Box drawing
    "▶" "◀"
    ;; I just want to see this as text
    "©" "™")
  "Characters that should never be affected by `emojify-mode'.")

(defadvice! emojify-delete-from-data ()
  "Ensure `emojify-disabled-emojis' don't appear in `emojify-emojis'."
  :after #'emojify-set-emoji-data
  (dolist (emoji emojify-disabled-emojis)
    (remhash emoji emojify-emojis)))
#+end_src

Now, it would be good to have a minor mode which allowed you to type ascii/gh
emojis and get them converted to unicode. Let's make one.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify--replace-text-with-emoji (orig-fn emoji text buffer start end &optional target)
  "Modify `emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji' to replace ascii/github emoticons with unicode emojis, on the fly."
  (if (or (not emoticon-to-emoji) (= 1 (length text)))
      (funcall orig-fn emoji text buffer start end target)
    (delete-region start end)
    (insert (ht-get emoji "unicode"))))

(define-minor-mode emoticon-to-emoji
  "Write ascii/gh emojis, and have them converted to unicode live."
  :global nil
  :init-value nil
  (if emoticon-to-emoji
      (progn
        (setq-local emojify-emoji-styles '(ascii github unicode))
        (advice-add 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji :around #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)
        (unless emojify-mode
          (emojify-turn-on-emojify-mode)))
    (setq-local emojify-emoji-styles (default-value 'emojify-emoji-styles))
    (advice-remove 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)))
#+end_src

This new minor mode of ours will be nice for messages, so let's hook it in for
Email and IRC.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! '(mu4e-compose-mode org-msg-edit-mode circe-channel-mode) (emoticon-to-emoji 1))
#+end_src
*** Doom modeline

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui modeline= module.
#+end_quote


Very nice and pretty, however I think the PDF modeline could do with tweaking.
I raised [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/pull/425][an issue]] on this, however the response was basically "put your
preferences in your personal config, the current default is sensible" --- so
here we are.

First up I'm going to want a segment for just the buffer file name, and a PDF
icon. Then we'll redefine two functions used to generate the modeline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! doom-modeline
  (doom-modeline-def-segment buffer-name
    "Display the current buffer's name, without any other information."

                         :v-adjust 0.02)))

  (defun doom-modeline-update-pdf-pages ()
    "Update PDF pages."
    (setq doom-modeline--pdf-pages
          (let ((current-page-str (number-to-string (eval `(pdf-view-current-page))))
                (total-page-str (number-to-string (pdf-cache-number-of-pages))))
            (concat
             (propertize
              (concat (make-string (- (length total-page-str) (length current-page-str)) ? )
                      " P" current-page-str)
              'face 'mode-line)
             (propertize (concat "/" total-page-str) 'face 'doom-modeline-buffer-minor-mode)))))

  (doom-modeline-def-segment pdf-pages

    (if (doom-modeline--active) doom-modeline--pdf-pages

*** Keycast

For some reason, I find myself demoing Emacs every now and then. Showing what
keyboard stuff I'm doing on-screen seems helpful. While [[https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey][screenkey]] does exist,
having something that doesn't cover up screen content is nice.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of Keycast-mode in action

Let's just make sure this is lazy-loaded appropriately.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! keycast

#+end_src

*** Screencast

In a similar manner to [[Keycast]], [[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast][gif-screencast]] may come in handy.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! gif-screencast :pin "5517a557a17d8016c9e26b0acb74197550f829b9")
#+end_src

We can lazy load this using the start/stop commands.

I initially installed ~scrot~ for this, since it was the default capture program.
However it raised ~glib error: Saving to file ... failed~ each time it was run.
Google didn't reveal any easy fixed, so I switched to [[https://github.com/naelstrof/maim][maim]]. We now need to pass
it the window ID. This doesn't change throughout the lifetime of an emacs
instance, so as long as a single window is used ~xdotool getactivewindow~ will
give a satisfactory result.

It seems that when new colours appear, that tends to make ~gifsicle~ introduce
artefacts. To avoid this we pre-populate the colour map using the current doom
theme.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! gif-screencast
  :commands gif-screencast-mode

  (map! :map gif-screencast-mode-map

*** Mixed pitch

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote


We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default. This was created
for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 27))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't to hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))

*** Marginalia

#+begin_quote
Part of the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Marginalia is nice, but the file metadata annotations are a little too plain.
Specifically, I have these gripes
+ File attributes would be nicer if coloured
+ I don't care about the user/group information if the user/group is me
+ When a file time is recent, a relative age (e.g. =2h ago=) is more useful than
  the date
+ An indication of file fatness would be nice

Thanks to the ~marginalia-annotator-registry~, we don't have to advise, we can
just add a new =file= annotator.

Another small thing is the face used for docstrings. At the moment it's =(italic
shadow)=, but I don't like that.

=all-the-icons= does a generally great job giving file names icons. One minor

*** Treemacs

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui treemacs= module.
#+end_quote

Quite often there are superfluous files I'm not that interested in. There's no
good reason for them to take up space. Let's add a mechanism to ignore them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! treemacs
  (defvar treemacs-file-ignore-extensions '()
    "File extension which `treemacs-ignore-filter' will ensure are ignored")
  (defvar treemacs-file-ignore-globs '()
    "Globs which will are transformed to `treemacs-file-ignore-regexps' which `treemacs-ignore-filter' will ensure are ignored")
  (defvar treemacs-file-ignore-regexps '()
    "RegExps to be tested to ignore files, generated from `treeemacs-file-ignore-globs'")
  (defun treemacs-file-ignore-generate-regexps ()
    "Generate `treemacs-file-ignore-regexps' from `treemacs-file-ignore-globs'"
    (setq treemacs-file-ignore-regexps (mapcar 'dired-glob-regexp treemacs-file-ignore-globs)))
  (if (equal treemacs-file-ignore-globs '()) nil (treemacs-file-ignore-generate-regexps))
  (defun treemacs-ignore-filter (file full-path)
    "Ignore files specified by `treemacs-file-ignore-extensions', and `treemacs-file-ignore-regexps'"
    (or (member (file-name-extension file) treemacs-file-ignore-extensions)
        (let ((ignore-file nil))
          (dolist (regexp treemacs-file-ignore-regexps ignore-file)
            (setq ignore-file (or ignore-file (if (string-match-p regexp full-path) t nil)))))))
  (add-to-list 'treemacs-ignored-file-predicates #'treemacs-ignore-filter))
#+end_src

Now, we just identify the files in question.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq treemacs-file-ignore-extensions
      '(;; LaTeX
        "aux"
        "ptc"

** Frivolities
*** Wttrin

Hey, let's get the weather in here while we're at it.
Unfortunately this seems slightly unmaintained ([[https://github.com/bcbcarl/emacs-wttrin/pulls][few open bugfix PRs]]) so let's
roll our [[file:lisp/wttrin/wttrin.el][own version]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! wttrin :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/wttrin"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! wttrin
  :commands wttrin)
#+end_src
*** Elcord

What's even the point of using Emacs unless you're constantly telling everyone
about it?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! elcord :pin "70fd716e673b724b30b921f4cfa0033f9c02d0f2")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! elcord
  :commands elcord-mode
  :config
  (setq elcord-use-major-mode-as-main-icon t))
#+end_src

** File types
*** Authinfo

My patch giving my patch giving =authinfo-mode= syntax highlighting is only
available in Emacs28+. For older versions, I've got a package I can use.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (< emacs-major-version 28) "packages.el" "no")
(package! authinfo-color-mode
  :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/authinfo-color-mode"))
#+end_src

Now we just need to load it appropriately.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (< emacs-major-version 28) "yes" "no")
(use-package! authinfo-color-mode
  :mode ("authinfo.gpg\\'" . authinfo-color-mode)
  :init (advice-add 'authinfo-mode :override #'authinfo-color-mode))
#+end_src

*** Systemd

For editing systemd unit files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! systemd :pin "b6ae63a236605b1c5e1069f7d3afe06ae32a7bae")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! systemd
  :defer t)
#+end_src

* Applications
** Ebooks

For managing my ebooks, I'll hook into the well-established ebook library
manager [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]]. A number of Emacs clients for this exist, but this seems like a
good option.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! calibredb :pin "2f2cfc38f2d1c705134b692127c3008ac1382482")
#+end_src

Then for reading them, the only currently viable options seems to be [[https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/][nov.el]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! nov :pin "8f5b42e9d9f304b422c1a7918b43ee323a7d3532")
#+end_src

Together these should give me a rather good experience reading ebooks.

=calibredb= lets us use calibre through Emacs, because who wouldn't want to use
something through Emacs?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! calibredb
  :commands calibredb
  :config

** Calculator

Emacs includes the venerable =calc=, which is a pretty impressive RPN (Reverse
Polish Notation) calculator. However, we can do a bit to improve the experience.

*** Defaults

Any sane person prefers radians and exact values.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq calc-angle-mode 'rad  ; radians are rad
      calc-symbolic-mode t) ; keeps expressions like \sqrt{2} irrational for as long as possible
#+end_src

*** CalcTeX

Everybody knows that mathematical expressions look best with LaTeX, so =calc='s
ability to create LaTeX representations of its expressions provides a lovely
opportunity which is taken advantage of in the CalcTeX package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! calctex :recipe (:host github :repo "johnbcoughlin/calctex"
                           :files ("*.el" "calctex/*.el" "calctex-contrib/*.el" "org-calctex/*.el" "vendor"))

#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Demonstration of calc, prettified by calctex.

We'd like to use CalcTeX too, so let's set that up, and fix some glaring
inadequacies --- why on earth would you commit a hard-coded path to an executable
that /only works on your local machine/, consequently breaking the package for
everyone else!?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
*** Embedded calc

Embedded calc is a lovely feature which let's us use calc to operate on LaTeX
maths expressions. The standard keybinding is a bit janky however (=C-x * e=), so
we'll add a localleader-based alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map calc-mode-map
      :after calc
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "E" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map latex-mode-map
      :after latex
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
#+end_src

Unfortunately this operates without the (rather informative) calculator and
trail buffers, but we can advice it that we would rather like those in a side
panel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar calc-embedded-trail-window nil)
(defvar calc-embedded-calculator-window nil)

(defadvice! calc-embedded-with-side-pannel (&rest _)
  :after #'calc-do-embedded
  (when calc-embedded-trail-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-trail-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-trail-window nil))
  (when calc-embedded-calculator-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-calculator-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window nil))
  (when (and calc-embedded-info
             (> (* (window-width) (window-height)) 1200))
    (let ((main-window (selected-window))
          (vertical-p (> (window-width) 80)))
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-trail-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-horizontally (- (max 30 (/ (window-width) 3))))
               (split-window-vertically (- (max 8 (/ (window-height) 4)))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calc Trail*")
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-vertically -6)
               (split-window-horizontally (- (/ (window-width) 2))))))

** Newsfeed

I really like what [[https://github.com/fuxialexander/doom-emacs-private-xfu/tree/master/modules/app/rss][fuxialexander]] has going on, but I don't think I need a custom
module. Let's just try to patch on the main things I like the look of.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Example elfeed entry
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/elfeed.png]]

*** Setup

By default it uses the .emacs.d folder, I prefer keeping the configs in the doom
folder with my literate config.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq rmh-elfeed-org-files (list "~/.doom.d/elfeed.org"))
#+end_src

New package for integrating youtube into elfeed, pretty neat.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! elfeed-tube :recipe (:host github :repo  "karthink/elfeed-tube"))
(package! aio)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! elfeed-tube
  :after elfeed
  :demand t
  :config
  ;; (setq elfeed-tube-auto-save-p nil) ;; t is auto-save (not default)
   (setq elfeed-tube-auto-fetch-p t) ;;  t is auto-fetch (default)
  (elfeed-tube-setup)

  :bind (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
         ("F" . elfeed-tube-fetch)
         ([remap save-buffer] . elfeed-tube-save)
         :map elfeed-search-mode-map
         ("F" . elfeed-tube-fetch)
         ([remap save-buffer] . elfeed-tube-save)))
#+end_src

*** Scoring

Using elfeed-score to sort my newsfeed by a point value that I determine.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! elfeed-score)
#+end_src

Another case of moving the config file to the doom folder for ease of tracking.
It's simply a plain text with a elisp s-expression as noted here:
https://www.unwoundstack.com/doc/elfeed-score/curr#The-Score-File
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! elfeed
(require 'elfeed-score)
(elfeed-score-enable)
(setq elfeed-score-serde-score-file "~/.doom.d/elfeed.score"))
#+end_src
*** Summary

Adding a dashboard style [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/elfeed-summary][summary]] into the newsfeed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! elfeed-summary)
#+end_src

TODO: need to clean this up, using the template config from the git repo.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

For some file types, we overwrite defaults in the [[file:./snippets][snippets]] directory, others
need to have a template assigned.

**** Mime types

Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">

What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")

**** Git diffs

Protesilaos wrote a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-26-git-diff-hunk-elisp-org/][very helpful article]] in which he explains how to change the
git diff chunk heading to something more useful than just the immediate line
above the hunk --- like the parent heading.

This can be achieved by first adding a new diff mode to git in =~/.config/git/attributes=
#+begin_src fundamental
,*.org   diff=org
#+end_src

Then adding a regex for it to =~/.config/git/config=
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.

  :pin "207c748aa5fea8626be619e8c55bdb1c16118c25")
#+end_src

We'll bind this to =O= on the org-mode localleader, and manually apply a [[https://github.com/Townk/org-ol-tree/pull/13][PR
recognising the pgtk window system]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

***** Cooking recipes

I *need* this in my life. It take a URL to a recipe from a common site, and

***** Importing with Pandoc

Sometimes I'm given non-org files, that's very sad. Luckily Pandoc offers a way
to make that right again, and this package makes that even easier to do.

***** Document comparison

It's quite nice to compare Org files, and the richest way to compare content is
probably =latexdiff=. There are a few annoying steps involved here, and so I've
written a package to streamline the process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! orgdiff :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/orgdiff"))
#+end_src

The only little annoyance is the fact that =latexdiff= uses ~#FF0000~ and ~#0000FF~ as
the red/blue change indication colours. We can make this a bit nicer by
post-processing the =latexdiff= result.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! orgdiff
  :defer t
  :config
  (defun +orgdiff-nicer-change-colours ()
    (goto-char (point-min))
    ;; Set red/blue based on whether chameleon is being used
    (if (search-forward "%% make document follow Emacs theme" nil t)
        (setq red  (substring (doom-blend 'red 'fg 0.8) 1)
              blue (substring (doom-blend 'blue 'teal 0.6) 1))
      (setq red  "c82829"
            blue "00618a"))
    (when (and (search-forward "%DIF PREAMBLE EXTENSION ADDED BY LATEXDIFF" nil t)
               (search-forward "\\RequirePackage{color}" nil t))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{red}{rgb}{1,0,0}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{red}{HTML}{%s}" red)))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{blue}{rgb}{0,0,1}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{blue}{HTML}{%s}" blue)))))

***** Org music

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

*** Behaviour
**** Tweaking defaults

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/.org"                      ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convenient
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})       ; don't treat lone _ / ^ as sub/superscripts, require _{} / ^{}
#+end_src
I also like the src_elisp{:comments} header-argument, so let's make that a
default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
(add-hook 'auto-save-hook 'org-save-all-org-buffers)
#+end_src

There also seem to be a few keybindings which use =hjkl=, but miss arrow key equivalents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-org-mode-map
      :after evil-org
      :n "g <up>" #'org-backward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <down>" #'org-forward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <left>" #'org-up-element
      :n "g <right>" #'org-down-element)
#+end_src
**** Extra functionality
***** Org buffer creation

Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb-ref none
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src
***** The utility of zero-width spaces

Occasionally in Org you run into annoyances where you want to have two seperate
blocks right together without a space. For example, to *emp​h*​asise part of a word,
or put a currency symbol immediately before an inline source block.
There is a solution to this, it just sounds slightly hacky --- zero width spaces.
Because this is Emacs, we can make this feel much less hacky by making a minor
addition to the Org key map 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :nie "M-SPC M-SPC" (cmd! (insert "\u200B")))
#+end_src

We then want to stop the space from being included in exports, which can be done
with a little filter.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-remove-zero-width-space (text _backend _info)
  "Remove zero width spaces from TEXT."
  (unless (org-export-derived-backend-p 'org)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "\u200B" "" text)))

(after! ox
  (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-export-remove-zero-width-space t))
#+end_src
***** List bullet sequence

I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src
***** Citation

Occasionally I want to cite something, and =org-ref= is /the/ package for that.

Unfortunately, it ignores the ~file = {...}~ =.bib= keys though. Let's fix that.
I separate files on =;=, which may just be a Zotero/BetterBibLaTeX thing, but it's
a good idea in my case at least.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(use-package! org-ref
  ;; :after org
  :defer t
  :config
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf-a ()
    :override #'org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf
    (save-excursion
      (bibtex-beginning-of-entry)
      (let* ((bibtex-expand-strings t)
             (entry (bibtex-parse-entry t))
             (key (reftex-get-bib-field "=key=" entry))
             (pdf (or
                   (car (-filter (lambda (f) (string-match-p "\\.pdf$" f))
                                 (split-string (reftex-get-bib-field "file" entry) ";")))
                   (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key))))
        (if (file-exists-p pdf)
            (org-open-file pdf)
          (ding)))))
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-pdf-at-point-a ()
    "Open the pdf for bibtex key under point if it exists."
    :override #'org-ref-open-pdf-at-point
    (interactive)
    (let* ((results (org-ref-get-bibtex-key-and-file))
           (key (car results))
           (pdf-file (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key)))
      (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect (cdr results))
        (save-excursion
          (bibtex-search-entry (car results))
          (org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf))))))

At some point in the future it could be good to investigate [[https://scripter.co/splitting-an-org-block-into-two/][splitting org blocks]].
Likewise [[https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/insert-math-symbol-in-emacs/][this]] looks good for symbols.

***** LSP support in ~src~ blocks

Now, by default, LSPs don't really function at all in ~src~ blocks.

***** View exported file

='localeader v= has no pre-existing binding, so I may as well use it with the same
functionality as in LaTeX. Let's try viewing possible output files with this.

Just setting the directory for the journal. Didn't want to mix and mesh with the
roam dailies.

**** Clock

Some settings for org-clock

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Habit

org-habit, I use this for repeating tasks (such as exercise) in my org-agenda
view. This allows for collecting certain datapoints in variables / notes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-habit)
#+end_src

**** Agenda

Adding the proper files to pull agenda from. This adds in the project-based
files in addition, since each could/can have their own todo.org file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files (apply 'append
      (mapcar

           directory org-agenda-file-regexp))
           '("~/.org/" "~/code/"))))

The agenda is nice, but a souped up version is nicer.

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries

prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)

**** Nicer generated heading IDs

Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's uninformative, I have no idea what's referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

**** Snippet Helpers

I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers
                                  (intern (concat "org-babel-default-header-args:"
                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))
                  values))
    (let ((selection (consult--read values :prompt question :default default-value)))
      (unless (or (string-match-p "(default)$" selection)
                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-lang ()
  "Try to find the current language of the src/header at `point'.
Return nil otherwise."
  (let ((context (org-element-context)))
    (pcase (org-element-type context)
      ('src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('inline-src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('keyword (when (string-match "^header-args:\\([^ ]+\\)" (org-element-property :value context))
                  (match-string 1 (org-element-property :value context)))))))

(defun +yas/org-last-src-lang ()
  "Return the language of the last src-block, if it exists."
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (when (re-search-backward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
      (org-element-property :language (org-element-context)))))

(defun +yas/org-most-common-no-property-lang ()
  "Find the lang with the most source blocks that has no global header-args, else nil."
  (let (src-langs header-langs)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) src-langs))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) header-langs)))

    (setq src-langs
          (mapcar #'car
                  ;; sort alist by frequency (desc.)
                  (sort
                   ;; generate alist with form (value . frequency)
                   (cl-loop for (n . m) in (seq-group-by #'identity src-langs)
                            collect (cons n (length m)))
                   (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b))))))

    (car (cl-set-difference src-langs header-langs :test #'string=))))
#+end_src

**** Translate capital keywords (old) to lower case (new)

Everyone used to use ~#+CAPITAL~ keywords. Then people realised that ~#+lowercase~
is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.
#+begin_quote
Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]
#+end_quote

To avoid sometimes having to choose between the hassle out of updating old
documents and using mixed syntax, I'll whip up a basic transcode-y function.
It likely misses some edge cases, but should mostly work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-syntax-convert-keyword-case-to-lower ()
  "Convert all #+KEYWORDS to #+keywords."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((count 0)
          (case-fold-search nil))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+[A-Z_]+" nil t)
        (unless (s-matches-p "RESULTS" (match-string 0))
          (replace-match (downcase (match-string 0)) t)
          (setq count (1+ count))))
      (message "Replaced %d occurances" count))))
#+end_src
**** Extra links
***** YouTube

The ~[[yt:...]]~ links preview nicely, but don't export nicely. Thankfully, we can
fix that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "yt" :export #'+org-export-yt)
(defun +org-export-yt (path desc backend _com)
  (cond ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
         (format "<iframe width='440' \
height='335' \
src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/%s' \
frameborder='0' \
allowfullscreen>%s</iframe>" path (or "" desc)))
        ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
         (format "\\href{https://youtu.be/%s}{%s}" path (or desc "youtube")))
        (t (format "https://youtu.be/%s" path))))
#+end_src
**** Fix problematic hooks

When one of the src_elisp{org-mode-hook} functions errors, it halts the hook
execution. This is problematic, and there are two hooks in particular which
cause issues. Let's make their failure less eventful.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! shut-up-org-problematic-hooks (orig-fn &rest args)
  :around #'org-fancy-priorities-mode
  (ignore-errors (apply orig-fn args)))
#+end_src
*** Visuals

Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

**** Font Display

Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src
Apparently this causes issues with some people, but I haven't noticed anything
problematic beyond the expected slight delay in some fontification, so until I
do I'll use the above.

**** Fontifying inline src blocks

Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.
#+end_warning

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-inline-src-prettify-results '("⟨" . "⟩"))
#+end_src

Doom theme's extra fontification is more problematic than helpful.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-themes-org-fontify-special-tags nil)
#+end_src

**** Symbols

It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ellipsis " ▾ "
      org-hide-leading-stars t
      org-priority-highest ?A
      org-priority-lowest ?E
      org-priority-faces
      '((?A . 'all-the-icons-red)
        (?B . 'all-the-icons-orange)
        (?C . 'all-the-icons-yellow)
        (?D . 'all-the-icons-green)
        (?E . 'all-the-icons-blue)))
#+end_src

It's also nice to make use of the =prettify-symbols-mode= for a few Org syntactic
tokens which we'd like to prettify that aren't covered by =org-modern= or any
other settings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(appendq! +ligatures-extra-symbols
          `(:list_property "∷"
            :em_dash       "—"

            :priority_d   ,(propertize "■" 'face 'all-the-icons-green)
            :priority_e   ,(propertize "■" 'face 'all-the-icons-blue)))
(set-ligatures! 'org-mode
  :merge t
  :list_property "::"
  :em_dash       "---"
  :ellipsis      "..."
  :arrow_right   "->"
  :arrow_left    "<-"
  :arrow_lr      "<->"
  :properties    ":PROPERTIES:"
  :end           ":END:"
  :priority_a    "[#A]"
  :priority_b    "[#B]"
  :priority_c    "[#C]"
  :priority_d    "[#D]"
  :priority_e    "[#E]")

**** LaTeX Fragments

***** Prettier highlighting

First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** More eager rendering

What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! org-fragtog :pin "680606189d5d28039e6f9301b55ec80517a24005")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering

It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).
Let's start by adding a sans font. I'd also like to use some of the
functionality from =bmc-maths=, so we'll load that too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-2.54cm}
\\setlength{\\evensidemargin}{\\oddsidemargin}
\\setlength{\\textheight}{\\paperheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headsep}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\footskip}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\topmargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-2.54cm}
% my custom stuff
\\usepackage[nofont,plaindd]{bmc-maths}
\\usepackage{arev}
")
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-options
      (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent"))
#+end_src

***** Rendering speed tests

We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135 \pm 2 ms | 215 \pm 3 ms    |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89 \pm 2 ms   | 178 \pm 2 ms   | 12 \pm 2 ms    |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226 \pm 2 ms | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392 \pm 4 ms | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230 \pm 2 ms | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[LaTeX Rendering]].

#+begin_warning
Unfortunately, it seems that SVG sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now.

*** Babel

Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

** Markdown

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
