* Justin's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, using [[https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm][rcm]]. If you

folders in the appropriate place, e.g.  =/.dotfiles/doom.d -> ~/.doom.d=

Note that I make use of emacs primarily, with nvim plugged into vscode for
occasions, bspwm/sxhkd/polybar with scripts for wal theming.
