These are my dotfiles, using [[https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm][rcm]]. If you
want to copy my config without using rcm, you could just clone and place the
folders in the appropriate place, e.g.  =/.dotfiles/doom.d -> ~/.doom.d=.

This isn't all-encompassing, as there's probably some python scripts and such
that aren't included, but I trust you'll be able to find the respective files if needed.

Note that I make use of emacs primarily, with nvim plugged into vscode for
occasions where it's more convenient.

** Thanks

- Primarily to tecosaur, whose [[tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][config]] for emacs I used as a base (and who is
  also a maintainer for quite a bit of the modules)
- [[https://github.com/hlissner][Henrik Lissner]], for making doom emacs, which I probably wouldn't have spent
  the time to jump into if not for the ease of use.
