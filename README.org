These are my dotfiles, using [[https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm][rcm]]. If you
want to copy my config without using rcm, you could just clone and place the
folders in the appropriate place, e.g.  =/.dotfiles/doom.d -> ~/.doom.d=.

This isn't 100%-all-encompassing, as there's probably some python scripts and such
that aren't included (pywal, etc.), but I trust you'll be able to find the respective files
if needed. Most are for programmatic theming and the core .configs are included here.

As of 07/2022 I've moved to awesome, but I'm keeping my bspwm config just as a curiosity if 
anyone wants. It works better for dynamic theming with no effort but there was a bit too much
jank for gaming (e.g, polybar not hiding even though restack is set to bspwm, etc.)

Note that I make use of emacs primarily, with nvim plugged into vscode for
occasions where it's more convenient.

** Thanks

- Primarily to tecosaur, whose [[tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][config]] for emacs I used as a base (and who is
  also a maintainer for quite a bit of the modules)
- [[https://github.com/hlissner][Henrik Lissner]], for making doom emacs, which I probably wouldn't have spent
  the time to jump into if not for the ease of use.
